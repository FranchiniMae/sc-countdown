# sc-countdown
Coding challenge - countdown timer for the end of 2016.

1. I spent 45 minutes on this exercise.
2. Tools:
..1. I used JavaScript because it is compatible with most, if not all, browsers. It is also the language I am most comfortable with. 
..2. I used JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation and make the code cleaner.
3. Bugs/Improvements:
..1. The page is responsive, but I would like to adjust the current media queries or possibly incorporate Bootstrap for faster web development.
..2. I would probaby make the timer more dynamic by including user input so people have the flexibility to have a countdown for other special events.
..3. With a dynamic countdown, another nice feature would be to incorporate an email notification for a more user-friendly experience.
